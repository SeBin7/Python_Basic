# Python_Basic

This repository is for practicing **Python fundamentals** and **coding test problems** step by step.  
The structure follows a learning roadmap: from basic syntax to small projects.

---

## Folder Structure
- `01_basics/` : Variables, operators, conditionals, loops
- `02_strings_lists/` : Strings, slicing, lists, dictionaries, sets
- `03_functions/` : Functions, lambda, recursion
- `04_patterns/` : Pattern printing (e.g., AlphabetPyramid)
- `05_oop/` : Object-oriented basics (classes, inheritance)
- `06_coding_test/` : Coding test solutions (.py for submission)
- `07_projects/` : Mini projects (e.g., BigramLM)

---

## Commit Convention
We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style:

**Pattern**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

### Types
- `feat` → new feature
- `fix` → bug fix
- `docs` → documentation only
- `style` → formatting, missing semi colons, etc.
- `refactor` → code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` → add or modify tests
- `chore` → maintenance tasks (build, configs, deps)

### Examples
- `feat(basics): add variables and data types examples`
- `fix(ct): correct remainder calculation`
- `docs: update README with roadmap`

---

## Development Workflow
1. Write exploration / notes in **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`)
2. Extract final solution into **Python script** (`.py`)
3. Commit with clear type and scope
4. Push and review via GitHub

---

## Future Plan
- Expand coding test solutions
- Add more pattern printing exercises
- Explore simple NLP/ML projects under `07_projects`
